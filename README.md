# Dawnbreak Warden
A game set in a post-apolptic world
# Making
Its still work in progress but it will take me alot of time since i need to make textures and audio and the code
Its using terasology (its gonna be modified alot) as a backend for it
# Modding
Modding will be possible the same way terasology can mod, using modules, you can also use [Fabric](https://wiki.fabricmc.net/documentation:fabric_loader#integrating_fabric_loader_into_a_dedicated_application) (yes fabric the modding thing for minecraft can work on any application just read the documentation) as it grants more power over modules considering that modules are limited by terasology engine, fabric isnt limited by anything but your own power

Its a random generated world meaning you cant memorize locations of stuff (Except for the Warden bossfight location) for new worlds which makes speedrunning harder, i did this to add variety to the game and make it a sandbox essentially so even after you finish it you still have stuff to do
and its possible to repeat the boss fight after u defeat it 
and with modding you can continue the storyline even beyond that if you so felt like it
# Documentation for modding and how to play
Its coming after the game is cmpleted
